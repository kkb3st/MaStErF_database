## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability through the "Issues" Page. 
We usually fix vulnerabilities fast (one or two days).

In General, our mods contain the original game with just modified files, so they should be pretty safe.
That means if a game contains a bug or a vulnerability, we have to wait until the game developers fix it.

If thereÂ´s a new version of a specific game, we update our mods as fast as we can.

Stay safe
